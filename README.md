# Topic : Image caption generator using CNN and LSTM 
# Flickr8k dataset
# Problem statement
Generating descriptive captions for images presents a significant challenge in computer vision and natural language processing, particularly when aiming to capture the nuanced content of diverse visual scenes. Developing an effective image caption generator using deep learning techniques is essential for automating this process, enabling efficient and accurate creation of textual descriptions that enhance understanding and accessibility of visual content. 
# Project Overview
Our project aims to develop an image caption generator using deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for extracting visual features and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for generating descriptive captions. By integrating CNNs to analyze images and LSTM networks to process sequential data, we automate the process of generating accurate and contextually relevant descriptions.
